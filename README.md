# BetterDoctor API Proxy

Requires elasticsearch and node/npm.

Create a .env file (see example.env for template).

Make sure elasticsearch is running locally before testing.

I can say for sure that all tests succeeded at the time of upload. However, it's uncertain if the external API will change in the future.

## Instructions

1. npm install
2. npm start (start local listener)
3. npm test (run unit tests)
